# Terrain Module - Part 4

## PLAYER PROPERTIES

We can modify each player's color, decals, race, and more in the Player Properties window. We're going to make Player 1's units blue, and make Player 1 always be Terran.

Open the Player Properties window by opening the "Map" menu option at the top of the editor and clicking on "Player Properties..."

Select Player 1 from the list on the left, and then change the Color option from (Any) to Blue. Then change the Race to Terran.

There are some other options that you may set in this window. We've changed Player 1's race to Terran, but left all of the other options alone.
