# Getting to the Editor

The Editor is bundled with all editions of StarCraft II, including Wings of Liberty, Heart of the Swarm, and Legacy of the Void. It is also included with the free StarCraft II Starter Edition. You can download the Starter Edition by heading to us.battle.net/arcade/en/download, pictured below.

Once you have downloaded the client, you can access the Editor through the Battle.net launcher.

You'll find the 'Launch Editor' button just below the header link in the launcher. The image below shows how this looks in two versions of the launcher.

Once you've launched it, the Editor will display its start-up screen while it loads. Depending on your game settings and the default map set to load, this may take some time. The start-up screen is shown below.
